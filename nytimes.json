      "lead_paragraph": "The last time the British got their hands on the White House, they set it on fire, and it didn't fare much better over a century and a half later when Leonard Bernstein and Alan Jay Lerner seized on it for their ill-fated 1976 musical ''1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.'' The show, the sole collaboration between two men of formidable talent and achievement, was one of the greatest flops in Broadway history, closing after only seven performances at the Mark Hellinger Theater and crashing with added percussiveness because of the lofty heights of public expectation from which it fell. ''Only two titans could have a failure like this,'' Jerome Robbins, the choreographer who had a brief involvement with the show, remarked. No cast recording was made, and no advocates like those who rescued Bernstein's ''Candide'' after its Broadway failure in 1956 came forward to champion ''1600.''",

      "lead_paragraph": "\"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\" was run over on its way to Broadway 16 years ago and has been in traction ever since. Its producers wanted one more smiling face for the Bicentennial, but Leonard Bernstein and Alan Jay Lerner, who wrote the music and the words, had more earnest matters on their minds. Revised (or vandalized, according to your tastes) by others, the show ran for seven performances at the Mark Hellinger Theater and disappeared. This musical-as-social-tract has been revived by the Indiana University Opera Theater, which brought a basically student production to the Kennedy Center Tuesday night. Presenting the show as a rehearsal, with the players in street clothes and a small orchestra concealed at the back of the stage, the Indiana company operated from an original script and score submitted by the two creators before the first run-throughs, long before the ultimate editing in which they had no voice.",

You'd think the country might have taken a breath and paused to mark a turning point in history over the weekend when barricades abruptly sealed off the White House from drive-by voyeurs.

After which everyone went back to talking about . . . Connie Chung. Perhaps you have to have tasted a particular kind of freedom yourself to feel its absence. Granted, the freedom to drive by the White House on a spring evening with the windows open is not one of the four freedoms that Franklin Roosevelt enshrined while living there. Maybe this freedom meant something to me because I grew up with it.",
